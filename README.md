Key Characteristics:
- Finite Impulse Response: The filter's impulse response is finite in duration, meaning that it settles to zero after a certain number of samples.
- Linear Phase Response: FIR filters can be designed to have a linear phase response, which is essential for applications where phase distortion needs to be minimized.
- Stability: FIR filters are always stable, as they do not have feedback loops that can cause instability.

How FIR Filters Work:
1. Input Signal: The input signal is fed into the FIR filter.
2. Tapped Delay Line: The input signal is delayed by a series of taps, each representing a sample of the input signal.
3. Coefficient Multiplication: Each tap is multiplied by a coefficient, which determines the filter's frequency response.
4. Summation: The weighted tap values are summed to produce the output signal.

Applications:
- Audio Processing: FIR filters are used in audio processing applications such as equalization, noise reduction, and echo cancellation.
- Image Processing: FIR filters are used in image processing applications such as image sharpening, blurring, and edge detection.
- Communication Systems: FIR filters are used in communication systems to shape the signal spectrum and remove noise.

Advantages:
- Simple Design: FIR filters have a simple design and are easy to implement.
- Linear Phase Response: FIR filters can be designed to have a linear phase response, which is essential for applications where phase distortion needs to be minimized.
- Stability: FIR filters are always stable, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

Disadvantages:
- Higher Order: FIR filters often require a higher order than IIR filters to achieve the same frequency response, which can increase computational complexity.
- Computational Complexity: FIR filters can be computationally intensive, especially for high-order filters.

In summary, FIR filters are a type of digital filter that offers simplicity, stability, and flexibility, making them suitable for a wide range of digital signal processingÂ applications.
